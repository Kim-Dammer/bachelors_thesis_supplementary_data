# Supplementary Data for Thesis on Lactose Fermentation Modeling

This repository contains supplementary data associated with the thesis on lactose fermentation modeling with *Streptococcus* (*strep*). The thesis focuses on improving the accuracy of fermentation models by incorporating cell proliferation dynamics into models, using the COPASI software [1].

Thank you for accessing and using this supplementary data for your research on lactose fermentation modeling!

## Repository Contents

The repository includes objective function values obtained from parameter estimation of different metabolic models at varying pH values. The data is provided in three files:

1. **`simple_no_constraints`**
   - **Description**: Contains objective function values from parameter estimation for a simplified metabolic model. This model has parameter estimation upper bounds set at $10^2$ and $10^4$, without any constraints on internal metabolites.


2. **`simple_with_constraints`**
   - **Description**: Contains objective function values from parameter estimation for a simplified metabolic model. This model includes parameter estimation upper bounds of $10^4$ and constraints on all internal metabolites with lower bounds of 0 mM and upper bounds of $10^2$, $10^3$, and $10^4$.


3. **`extended_with_constraints`**
   - **Description**: Contains objective function values from parameter estimation for an extended metabolic model. This model includes parameter estimation upper bounds of $10^4$ and constraints on all internal metabolites with lower bounds of 0 mM and upper bounds of $10^2$, $10^3$, and $10^4$.
